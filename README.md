# What?

This is my personal scratchpad and journal of rust test programs.

# Which?

The kind of programs in here include things like "How many letters are there?" and simple guessing games. Pretty much anything that I can't remember exactly or to test basic functionality.

Also includes a bunch of toying around with libraries.
